# Chatbot-for-On-Demand-Website-Information
Developed a Chatbot designed to provide on-demand information based on user queries related to 
the NIT Trichy website. The project involved scraping data from the NIT Trichy website, including 
textual content and PDF files, using Data Scraping tools. A Vector Database was constructed to enable 
In-Context Learning, also referred to as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The chatbot utilized 
Mosaic's MPT a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Additionally, Fine-tuned the MPT-7B base model to make sure the generated text matched the 
required tone and style, improving its relevance and usability.
