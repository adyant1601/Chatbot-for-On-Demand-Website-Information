# Chatbot-for-On-Demand-Website-Information
Developed a Chatbot designed to provide on-demand information based on user queries related to 
the NIT Trichy website. The project involved scraping data from the NIT Trichy website, including 
textual content and PDF files, using **Data Scraping tools**. A **Vector Database** was constructed to enable 
**In-Context Learning**, also referred to as **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The chatbot utilized 
**Mosaic's MPT a large language model (LLM)** to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Additionally, **Fine-tuned** the **MPT-7B base model** to make sure the generated text matched the 
required tone and style, improving its relevance and usability.
